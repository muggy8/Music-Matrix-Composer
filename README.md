# Music-Matrix-Composer
This is the Music Matrix Composer for everyone to play with.

The SQL file is a bit weird. You would need to change mugdev_com in the top line with your own data base name that you want to use and the user that you want to use to work with (assuming XAMPP)

You also have to change the stuff in configs/sqlConnect.php to use your own login username and password as well to make it work.

Special thanks to the following people for making this program possiable: 

Mudcube: Midi.JS
